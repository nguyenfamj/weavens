            - If the message is a question related to buying property in Finland, classify it as "house_buying_knowledge_question"
            - If the message is about finding a property to buy in Finland, classify it as "finding_property_finland"
            - For questions that do not fall under the above categories or cannot be answered based on the chat history, classify it as "unsupported_intent"
